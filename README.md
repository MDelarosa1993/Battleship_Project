Reflection 
1. We followed the functionality checklist and bit each component off individually got that function working. 

2. Playing with board size and custom ships. Would love to see how a 10 by 10 game would look with ships like carrier, uboat, and battleship herself. Id also like to see the difficulty of making our computer smarter.  

3. We used Driver Navigator and also hopped in Study hall and coded on our own branches but were in call to exchange feedback and ideas along the way. We also did you a bit of async work during the weekend and when others were still up as others were winding down. 

4. We used Slack group chat, used study hall for immediate feedback. We also tried to use comments on our github repo pull requests as best as possible.
